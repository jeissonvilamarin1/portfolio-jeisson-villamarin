              looking for a position as a Frontend Junior with emphasis in
              React, my interest in web development begins when i start building
              a website with WordPress for the family bussiness (this teach me a
              lot how the web pages work specially the box model), since then
              i've been learning Javascript and React.
            </p>

              learning, and improving my skills.
